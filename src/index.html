			<h2>Our Foundation</h2>
			<p>Odysseus, as made famous by Homer’s epic poem, The Illiad, was one of the greatest heroes in Greek mythology who fought
				during the Trojan War. Odysseus was known for his cunning intellect and helped devise the plan that conquered the city
				of Troy and ended the Trojan War. In Homer’s second epic, The Odyssey, Odysseus wanders the seas for ten years, overcoming
				countless obstacles and challenges as he continues his long journey home.</p>
			<p>Enter Odyssey, a cutting edge sports and entertainment marketing company founded by a team of sports enthusiasts and event
				gurus that live for entertaining the masses and conquering the ongoing sea that is digital marketing. We pride ourselves
